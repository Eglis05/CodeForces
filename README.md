## Competitive Programming Exercises
Here I will post most of the exercises I have solved which have to do with competitive programming.\
Most of them are put in random_x directory where x can be one of the {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e"} problems.\
They go from the easiest, "a", to the hardest, "e".\
Unless they are from different divisons which I didnt make a separation as there would be many directories.\
It goes without saying that there are more solved in the easy part than the hard ones.\
At some point I started using a template but that shouldnt frighten you :)
